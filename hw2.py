# text = """Advertising companies say advertising is necessary and important. It informs people about new products. 
# Advertising hoardings in the street make our environment colourful. And adverts on TV are often funny. Sometimes 
# they are mini-dramas and we wait for the next programme in the mini-drama. Advertising can educate, too. Adverts 
# tell us about new, healthy products. And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, be fashionable 
# and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless. But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing. 
# They say that advertising is bad for children. Adverts make children ‘pester’ their parents buy things for them. 
# Advertisers know we love our children and want to give them everything. So they use children’s ‘pester power’ to sell their products. 
# Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must be rules. Some adverts advertise unhealthy things 
# like cigarettes and make people waste their money."""
